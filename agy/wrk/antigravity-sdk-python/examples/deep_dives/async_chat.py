"""Fully async peer-to-peer agent chat — no rounds.

Contrast with round_based_chat.py which uses synchronized parallel
rounds via asyncio.gather. Here, each agent runs its own independent
loop and reacts whenever any peer posts a new message. Ordering is
emergent — whoever finishes agent.chat() first gets the next word.

Demonstrates:
- Custom functions: pass_turn() lets agents choose silence.
- asyncio.Condition: reactive wake-up when any agent posts.

Trade-offs vs. the round-based model:
- Pro: no forced synchronization; fast agents respond immediately.
- Pro: naturally self-terminating via consecutive pass limits.
- Con: a fast agent can dominate if consistently quicker.
- Con: agents may not see every message before responding.

Run:
    python async_chat.py

Criteria for correct script performance:
  1. The script exits cleanly with return code 0 (no unhandled exceptions).
  2. At least two agents produce substantive responses during the
     discussion.
  3. The conversation transcript contains entries from multiple agents.
  4. The discussion terminates, either because agents passed
     consecutively or because the timeout was reached.
