"""Synchronized parallel agent chat room with opt-out.

Three agents (Rational Rita, Creative Cal, Skeptical Sam) discuss topics
as equals. All agents process in parallel each round. Each can call
pass_turn() to stay silent. Conversation continues until all agents pass
or the max depth is reached.

Demonstrates:
- Custom functions: pass_turn() lets agents choose silence.
- Triggers: a 60s timer nudges all agents to wrap up.
- Async parallelism: all agents think simultaneously via asyncio.gather.

Design note: we use agent.chat() in parallel via asyncio.gather rather
than a purely trigger-driven model. TriggerContext.send() delivers
messages and returns the response, but it bypasses Agent.chat() and
operates on the Connection directly. The agent.chat() approach gives us
explicit round management and prompt injection. See async_chat.py
for a fully reactive alternative using asyncio.Condition.

Run:
    python round_based_chat.py

Criteria for correct script performance:
  1. The script exits cleanly with return code 0 (no unhandled exceptions).
  2. All three agents (Rita, Cal, Sam) produce at least one substantive
     response across the discussion topics.
  3. Agents respond in parallel each round before the next round begins.
  4. The final transcript contains turns from multiple agents across
     both discussion topics.
