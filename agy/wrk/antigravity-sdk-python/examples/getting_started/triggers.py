"""Example demonstrating background triggers in Google Antigravity SDK.

Triggers are long-lived async functions that run in the background alongside
an active agent session. They react to external events (such as timers, file
changes, or webhooks) and push automated trigger notifications back to the
agent connection.

This example demonstrates:
1. Periodic Triggers (using the `every` helper) - Simulating SRE Ticket Queues.
2. Custom Triggers (using `@triggers.trigger` decorator) - Simulating CI/CD
   Webhook listeners.

To run:
  python triggers.py

Criteria for correct script performance:
  1. The script exits cleanly with return code 0 (no unhandled exceptions).
  2. The periodic trigger fires and sends a system alert to the agent.
  3. The custom CI/CD trigger fires and sends a build failure alert.
  4. The agent acknowledges the trigger notifications in its responses.
