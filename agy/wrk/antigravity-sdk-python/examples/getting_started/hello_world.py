"""Simple hello world example for Google Antigravity SDK.

This example demonstrates the simplest way to interact with an agent:
- Creating a configuration (and how to explicitly select a model).
- Using the Agent context manager.
- Sending a simple prompt and awaiting the full text response.

To run:
  python hello_world.py

Criteria for correct script performance:
  1. The script exits cleanly with return code 0 (no unhandled exceptions).
  2. The agent produces a non-empty text response.
  3. The response contains "Hello World" or a close greeting variant.
