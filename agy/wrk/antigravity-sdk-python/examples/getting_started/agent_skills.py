"""Example demonstrating skill loading for Google Antigravity SDK.

This example demonstrates how to use `skills_paths` in `LocalAgentConfig`
to point to a directory containing skills and how the agent can recognize them.

To run:
  python agent_skills.py

Criteria for correct script performance:
  1. The script exits cleanly with return code 0 (no unhandled exceptions).
  2. "Loading skills from:" appears in the output, confirming the skill path
     was resolved.
  3. The agent produces a non-empty response when asked about its skills.
  4. The agent's response references at least one skill or capability by name.
