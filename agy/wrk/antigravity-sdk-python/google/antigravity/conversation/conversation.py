"""Stateful conversation session for the Google Antigravity SDK.

Conversation is the Layer 2 session API. It wraps a Connection with:
- Step history accumulation (with compaction index tracking)
- A chat() convenience method (send + collect in one call)
- State introspection (idle, turn count, last response)

Layer 1 (Agent) delegates to Conversation; power users can use
Conversation directly with any ConnectionStrategy.
